C[Two mid-Dan Games
Commentary:  Guo Juan 5P
Game Editor:  Myron Souris
Published in the May 8, 2018 edition of the American Go E-Journal

Guo Juan 5P covers a couple games between mid-dan level players.  The 1st game, between a 2 dan and 5 dan, highlights issues relating to strong vs. weak stones.  The 2nd game, between a 2 dan and 7 dan, beautifully illustrates how to choose the direction of play.

A tip about direction of play:  Try to place your stones in the interesting area, and push his stones to the less interesting area.  We should choose the moves that make this idea happen.]
